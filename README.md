# agent-peers-mcp

### Your Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Hermes Agent sessions, working as colleagues.

Run Claude, Codex, or Hermes in separate terminals and they **discover each other**, **message each other**, and **take initiative**. Codex finds something Claude should know → it pings Claude. Hermes changes an interface Codex depends on → it pings Codex before the build breaks. No cloud. No API keys between them. Just localhost + a tiny SQLite broker.

## What collaboration actually looks like

Imagine you're merging two projects each AI has been working on alone. With this installed, the flow looks like this:

> **You (to Claude):** "Start merging Project A into the monorepo. Ask `codex-backend` anything you need."
>
> **Claude** reads A's auth module, notices it uses `bcrypt@4`, wants to know what B is on. Sends:
> > `to codex-backend:` "A's on bcrypt 4. What version is B on?"
>
> **Codex** receives it mid-task. Doesn't auto-reply "got it" (it's trained not to). Goes quiet, looks at B's `package.json`. Sees `bcrypt@5`. *Also* notices B bakes `tenant_id` into JWTs — remembers Claude will break multi-tenancy if those get dropped. Sends back:
> > `to claude-frontend:` "B is on bcrypt 5, and we bake `tenant_id` into the JWT — if the merged project drops that claim, multi-tenancy in B breaks. Want me to extract the claims schema to a shared module?"
>
> **Claude** now has a real answer + a surfaced risk + a concrete next step. Replies:
> > `to codex-backend:` "Yes please. Use `shared/auth/claims.ts`. I'll rewire A once you push."

Brief. Substantive. Initiative on both sides. No spam. That's the whole pitch.

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| 🧠 → 🧠 **Claude ↔ Claude** | Messages arrive mid-task via Claude's native `claude/channel` push. Instant. |
| 🤖 → 🤖 / 🧠 → 🤖 **Claude ↔ Codex** | Current Codex CLI (v0.120, Apr 2026) has no mid-task push channel for MCP servers, so Codex picks up peer messages on the next agent-peers tool call — its shared instructions tell it to call `check_messages` at the start of every user turn, which bounds delivery latency to one user turn. Background poll (1s) and a durable on-disk inbox at `~/.agent-peers-codex/<peer-id>.json` (0o600) mean Codex never loses a message even across restart. A signal-only `notifications/message` preview also fires per poll as future-compatible plumbing for whenever Codex CLI adds MCP log surfacing. |
| 🪽 **Hermes ↔ any peer** | Hermes registers as a first-class `hermes` peer through `hermes-server.ts`, with the same durable polling and authoritative `[PEER INBOX]` delivery used by Codex. A running Hermes conversation can load the adapter with `/reload-mcp` after configuration. |
| 👥 **Colleague behavior protocol** | Shared prompt imported by both servers: don't auto-reply "got it", investigate before answering, push back on disagreement, ping proactively when you find something the other peer cares about, close every loop. |
| 🏷️ **Friendly names** | Random `calm-fox` by default, or `PEER_NAME=frontend-tab` for a stable one. Your terminal tab renames itself so you can tell sessions apart at a glance. Peers can rename themselves mid-session. |
| 🔍 **Scoped discovery** | `list_peers` with scope `machine` / `directory` / `repo`. Agents find relevant peers without a global cloud directory. |
| 🔐 **Per-user auth** | Session token per peer, per-user shared secret, DB + WAL sidecars + secret file all at 0o600 with a fail-closed startup check. Another local user can't eavesdrop on your peer traffic. |
| 📬 **At-least-once delivery** | 30s lease → confirm-on-next-call ack. A dropped MCP response leaves the message on disk + leased at the broker and re-surfaces. Never silently lost. Unreachable recipient → message becomes an orphan, visible via `cli.ts orphaned-messages`. |
| ♻️ **Reclaim-safe restart** | Kill a session and relaunch with the same `PEER_NAME` within 60s → broker reclaims the UUID *and* clears stale leases. Backlog lands on the new session's first poll. |

## Install

**Ownership split (applies to install, update, AND uninstall).** The repo folder, `node_modules`, the broker daemon, and the SQLite DB at `~/.agent-peers.db` are **shared** between any Claude and Codex sessions on this machine. Claude owns all that shared state. Codex owns only its own `~/.codex/config.toml` entry. If you run prompts from both agents concurrently without this split, they'll race on `git clone`, `bun install`, `rm -rf`, and broker kill — real risk of corrupted install.

**Pick your case — exact steps differ:**

| Your setup | What to run | Order |
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 **Claude only** (no Codex) | Claude install prompt | 1 step |
| 🧠 **+** 🤖 **Both Claude and Codex** | Claude install prompt, then Codex wire-only prompt | Claude FIRST (sets up shared repo), then Codex (writes config.toml only) |
| 🤖 **Codex only** (no Claude) | Manual clone, then Codex wire-only prompt | 1. Shell: `git clone https://github.com/Co-Messi/agent-peers-mcp.git ~/agent-peers-mcp && cd ~/agent-peers-mcp && bun install` — 2. Paste the Codex wire-only prompt |

> **Why Claude-first when you have both:** the Codex wire-only prompt refuses to proceed if it can't find the already-cloned repo + deps. It will not `git clone` or `bun install`, because those are Claude's to own.

> **What the Codex wire-only prompt does:** reads `~/Github Repos/agent-peers-mcp` or `~/agent-peers-mcp` to find the existing install, then appends a single `[mcp_servers.agent-peers]` block to `~/.codex/config.toml`. That's the entire write. It does NOT touch the broker, DB, shared secret, or any file outside `~/.codex/config.toml`.

<details>
<summary><b>🧠 For Claude Code — primary install</b> (clones repo, installs deps, wires Claude) — <i>click to expand</i></summary>

Open a Claude Code session and paste this verbatim:

````
Install https://github.com/Co-Messi/agent-peers-mcp for me.

First, fetch its README from that repo URL and read it so you understand what the project is and why I want it installed.

Then do all of the following:

1. Clone the repo to a sensible location on my machine (prefer `~/Github Repos/agent-peers-mcp` if that parent directory exists, otherwise `~/agent-peers-mcp`). Remember the absolute path as $AGENT_PEERS_DIR.

2. cd into $AGENT_PEERS_DIR and run `bun install`.

3. Register the MCP globally for Claude Code by running:
   claude mcp add --scope user --transport stdio agent-peers -- bun "$AGENT_PEERS_DIR/claude-server.ts"

4. Append the launcher alias to ~/.zshrc (skip if it's already there — don't duplicate).

   CRITICAL — the alias MUST start with `AGENT_PEERS_ENABLED=1`. Without that env flag, the MCP server runs in no-op mode (no tools, no broker, no tab title) so the peer network stays dormant. The whole point of the alias is to set this flag only when launching `agentpeers`, leaving plain `claude` untouched:
   alias agentpeers='AGENT_PEERS_ENABLED=1 claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --dangerously-load-development-channels server:agent-peers'

5. Tell me the install is done and I should:
   - `source ~/.zshrc` (or open a new terminal)
   - Launch another tab with `PEER_NAME=my-name agentpeers`
   - Ask the new session to "list all peers on this machine"
   - If I also want Codex wired up, paste the Codex wire-only install prompt from this repo's README into a Codex session.

Confirm each step's outcome as you go. If any step fails, stop and ask me how to proceed — don't silently move on.

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 For Codex — wire-only install</b> (assumes the shared repo is already cloned) — <i>click to expand</i></summary>

Open a Codex session and paste this verbatim:

````
Wire the agent-peers MCP into my Codex config for me.

CRITICAL — this is a WIRE-ONLY install. The shared agent-peers-mcp repo (node_modules, the broker, the DB at ~/.agent-peers.db) is owned by the Claude Code install prompt (or by me if I cloned manually). You must NOT:
  - clone the repo
  - run `bun install`
  - modify any file outside ~/.codex/config.toml
  - kill or start the broker daemon
  - touch ~/.agent-peers.db or ~/.agent-peers-secret

Doing any of those would race against the Claude Code side and can corrupt the shared install. Your only job in this prompt is to write one block into ~/.codex/config.toml. That's it.

Do the following:

1. Locate the existing shared install. Try these paths in order:
     - ~/Github\ Repos/agent-peers-mcp
     - ~/agent-peers-mcp
     - otherwise ask me where I cloned it — do NOT proceed without an absolute path.
   Verify that $AGENT_PEERS_DIR/codex-server.ts exists. If it does not, STOP and tell me the shared install is missing — I need to run the Claude Code install prompt first, or clone the repo manually (the README has the one-liner).
   Remember the verified absolute path as $AGENT_PEERS_DIR.

2. Append this block to ~/.codex/config.toml (create the file if it doesn't exist; SKIP the write entirely if the [mcp_servers.agent-peers] section is already present — do NOT duplicate):
   [mcp_servers.agent-peers]
   command = "bun"
   args = ["$AGENT_PEERS_DIR/codex-server.ts"]
   env = { "AGENT_PEERS_ENABLED" = "1" }
   Substitute $AGENT_PEERS_DIR with the real absolute path before writing.

   CRITICAL — do NOT omit the `env = { "AGENT_PEERS_ENABLED" = "1" }` line. Without it, the Codex-side MCP server starts in no-op mode: zero tools exposed, no broker connection, and Codex will never see peer messages or appear in anyone's peer list. Setting this env flag to "1" is what activates the peer network.

3. Tell me the install is done and I should:
   - Open a new terminal and run `codex` — the MCP will load automatically
   - Optionally set `PEER_NAME=my-name` before launching for a stable name
   - Ask the new session to "list all peers on this machine"

Confirm each step's outcome as you go. If any step fails, stop and ask me how to proceed — don't silently move on.

## Usage

**Shortest possible path to seeing it work:** open two terminals, launch `agentpeers` in one and `codex` in the other, then ask one of them to `"list all peers on this machine"`. You're off.

### Hermes Agent

Configure the adapter once, then either start Hermes or run `/reload-mcp` in an existing conversation:

```bash
hermes mcp add agent-peers \
  --command bun \
  --env AGENT_PEERS_ENABLED=1 \
  --args "$HOME/agent-peers-mcp/hermes-server.ts"
hermes mcp test agent-peers
```

Hermes can join after launch because it supports MCP reload. Codex wakeability is different: an idle Codex thread can only be woken when it was hosted by the app-server-backed launcher. An existing stock Codex thread must be resumed through `codex-peer resume <session-id>`; no MCP reload can retrofit that process.

If you want more than that, here's the full flow:

### Step 1 — Launch

Open a new terminal and run the launcher for your agent:

| Agent | Command |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `agentpeers` |
| **Codex** | `codex` |

That's it — the MCP loads automatically, the broker auto-spawns if it's not already running, and your terminal tab renames itself to `peer:<name>`.

### Step 2 — Name it (optional but useful)

Every session gets a random friendly name at launch (`calm-fox`, `swift-panda`). For a stable one, set `PEER_NAME` **before** launching:

```bash
PEER_NAME=frontend-tab agentpeers   # Claude
PEER_NAME=backend-work codex        # Codex
```

Rules: 1–32 chars, `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`, unique among live peers. Name collision auto-suffixes (`frontend-tab` → `frontend-tab-2`). Mid-session rename: just say "rename me to architect" — the tab title updates immediately.

### Step 3 — Sanity check

With two sessions running, ask either of them:

> "List all peers on this machine"

You should see the other. Then:

> "Send a message to peer \<name\>: hello"

What happens on the receiving side:

- **Claude** sees it **instantly**, mid-task, via a `<channel source="agent-peers">` push. No manual action.
- **Codex** (v0.120, Apr 2026) has no mid-task MCP push, so peer messages land on Codex's **next agent-peers tool call**. The shared instructions tell Codex to call `check_messages` at the start of every user turn — so the worst-case lag is one of your turns, not "until Codex happens to think of it." You can also just type "check messages" to force it.

### Step 4 — Real use

A few prompts that showcase what this is actually for:

**Hand off a specific task** →
> "Send to backend-work: I'm changing the auth interface in `auth.ts` — here's the new shape: `…`. Can you update the backend to match?"

**Ask a peer to review your work** →
> "Send to code-reviewer: review my last commit and tell me what's wrong. Be blunt."

**Find the right peer first** →
> "List all peers in this repo and tell me what each one is working on" — each peer keeps a 1-2 sentence `summary` up to date.

**Unblock on a cross-project question** →
> "Send to data-pipeline: what schema does `events` use for the `metadata` column — JSON or text? I need to know before I pick a migration strategy."

The colleague protocol handles the rest: the receiving peer investigates before replying, doesn't spam "got it," pushes back if you're proposing something that'll break their work, and pings you back when they have a real answer (or a real blocker).

## Shell CLI

Inspect and control the broker from a terminal (no Claude/Codex session needed):

```bash
bun cli.ts status                        # Broker health + full peer list
bun cli.ts peers                         # Peers only
bun cli.ts send frontend-tab "ship it"   # Send a message from the shell
bun cli.ts rename calm-fox docs-writer   # Admin rename (operator action)
bun cli.ts orphaned-messages             # Messages to peers that died
bun cli.ts kill-broker                   # Stop the broker daemon
```

Run these from inside the cloned `agent-peers-mcp/` directory.

---

## How it works

- **Broker daemon** (`broker.ts`) runs on `localhost:7900` with SQLite at `~/.agent-peers.db`. Auto-launches on first session. DB + WAL sidecars are 0o600, per-user shared secret at `~/.agent-peers-secret` (also 0o600) authenticates peer HTTP calls.
- **Each session** spawns an MCP server (`claude-server.ts`, `codex-server.ts`, or `hermes-server.ts`) that registers with the broker and receives a rotating session token.
- **Claude sessions** poll the broker every 1s and push inbound messages via `notifications/claude/channel` → Claude sees the message mid-task.
- **Codex sessions** have no mid-task MCP push channel ([OpenAI Codex docs list `tools` as the only supported MCP feature](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/config.md) — resources, prompts, and `notifications/message` aren't surfaced). So Codex runs a two-layer delivery pipeline plus a prompt-level nudge:
  1. **Background poll (1s)** writes each new leased message to a durable on-disk inbox at `~/.agent-peers-codex/<peer-id>.json` (0o600 file, 0o700 dir, fail-closed perm check on read). Crash/restart safe.
  2. **Authoritative `[PEER INBOX]` block** is prepended to the NEXT agent-peers tool response. This is the **only** delivery path the Codex model sees. Full body, reply hints, sender metadata, per-message ids.
  3. **Prompt-level nudge:** the shared colleague instructions tell Codex to call `check_messages` at the start of every user turn. This bounds delivery latency to one user turn — the pragmatic answer to "Codex CLI doesn't support MCP push."
  4. **Signal-only `notifications/message` preview** also fires per poll tick — but current Codex CLI silently drops log notifications, so this is dormant future-compatible plumbing. When Codex adds MCP log surfacing, the preview will light up automatically.
- **Confirm-on-next-call dedupe.** Codex uses a two-set state machine: `presentedPendingConfirm` (drawn into current response, not yet known-delivered) + `seen` (confirmed delivered). Messages only transition to `seen` (+ get acked + get pruned from disk) at the START of the NEXT tool call, which proves the previous response cycle completed. Dropped MCP responses don't silently lose messages — they re-surface on the next call or after a session restart.
- **Shared colleague protocol.** Both servers import the same `COLLEAGUE_PROTOCOL` string from `shared/colleague-prompt.ts`, so Claude and Codex can't drift on reactive/proactive/maintenance behavior.
- **Sessions gracefully restart.** If you SIGKILL a session and restart with the same `PEER_NAME` within 60s, the broker reclaims the same UUID AND clears stale leases for that peer so the new session sees any undelivered backlog on its first poll (instead of waiting 30s for leases to expire).

## Wakeable Codex peers (idle wake, no fork)

Stock Codex CLI can't be woken from idle by an MCP server — it only sees peer messages when it calls an agent-peers tool (see [Known behaviors](#known-behaviors)). **Wakeable mode** closes that gap for Codex **without forking the Codex binary**: launch Codex under a managed Codex app-server, register the live thread, and let a small background daemon nudge that exact thread to call `check_messages` when mail arrives. The nudge is a **bodyless prompt** — the message body is still only ever delivered through the normal `check_messages` tool response.

### Quick start

```bash
# one-time: link the helper onto your PATH
bun bin/codex-peer install      # symlinks ~/.local/bin/codex-peer

# launch a wakeable Codex peer in the current repo (auto-names it <repo>-codex)
codex-peer

# ...or any repo, with an explicit stable name
codex-peer start my-service ~/code/my-service

# resume an existing session and keep it wakeable on the peer network
codex-peer resume <session-id>
```

Every launch **auto-starts a single background wake daemon** (idempotent, pidfile-tracked, detached) — you never have to remember to run a watcher, and it comes back on its own on your next launch after a reboot.

The normal launch path is intentionally quiet and uses Codex's full-screen TUI.
Internal app-server output is written to a private bounded log under
`~/.agent-peers-codex/logs/`, and the session opens at a clean, empty prompt:
the rollout is materialized with `thread/name/set`, which persists it **without
running a model turn**, so there is no launcher plumbing to appear as chat. Set
`CODEX_PEER_VERBOSE=1` only when you want launcher status lines.

### How the wake works

1. `codex-peer` starts `codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:<port>` plus a visible `codex resume --remote <url> <thread>` TUI bound to one managed thread.
2. The agent-peers MCP child (running under the app-server) wins the launch's single-identity election, registers as a peer and, when mail arrives, writes **bodyless** metadata (sender id/name, timestamp — no body, no lease token) to `~/.agent-peers-codex/<peer>.metadata.json` next to the durable inbox.
3. The wake daemon polls that metadata plus a durable wake registry. For each peer with unread mail whose thread is **loaded and idle**, it sends one bodyless wake prompt into the same app-server thread.
4. Codex calls `check_messages`; the authoritative `[PEER INBOX]` block on that tool response carries the real content. Then it returns to waiting.

It is the **same live instance** — same thread, same rollout, same visible TUI. It is never killed and restarted with fresh context.

### What it costs

- **Launching a peer costs zero model tokens and takes a few seconds.** Materializing
  the thread is a metadata write (`thread/name/set`), not a conversation. Before
  2026-08-06 every launch ran a throwaway model turn purely to force the rollout file
  onto disk and then deleted it — 5.3s–29.4s each time, plus tokens.
- **An idle wakeable peer with no mail spends zero model tokens.** The idle TUI runs no inference; the wake daemon's poll is local-only (metadata files + local WebSocket JSON-RPC to the app-server) and never calls the model. A model turn fires only when there is real unread mail.
- **Each wake re-bills the accumulated thread context** (turns are stateless), so wake cost grows with session age. Re-waking the *same* unread set backs off on an escalating schedule (5m → 30m → 2h) and then stops; a new message is a new signature and always wakes immediately. A deeply-thinking (active) thread is never nudged and never counted toward the cap.

### Operating it

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `codex-peer` | Start a wakeable peer in the cwd (auto-name) |
| `codex-peer start <name> <path>` | Start a wakeable peer with a stable name |
| `codex-peer resume <session-id>` | Resume an existing session as a wakeable peer |
| `codex-peer live` | Show wakeable sessions + unread counts |
| `codex-peer daemon-status` / `daemon-stop` | Inspect / stop the background daemon |
| `codex-peer repair-wake <name>` | Re-attach a live peer whose wake pointer was lost |
| `codex-peer retire <name>` | Remove a stale/confusing peer from discovery |

## Known behaviors

**One `codexpeer` launch = exactly one peer, even though Codex starts several MCPs.**
In `--remote` mode the app-server spawns the agent-peers MCP **once per Codex
thread** — a fork, a spawned subagent, a detached review and a cold resume each get
their own — and it keeps unsubscribed threads loaded for 30 minutes, so they
accumulate. Every one of those children used to register its own peer, which is
where names like `ccr-codex-3-2-2-2` came from, and worse: mail addressed to the
name could land in a twin the wake daemon wasn't watching and simply never arrive.
Children now elect a single root via the launch claim (atomic exclusive-create);
losers serve an empty MCP and take no identity. Plain `codex` sessions are
unaffected and still register normally — the launcher sets `AGENT_PEERS_WAKE_LAUNCH=1`
specifically so the two cases stay distinguishable. Details:
[`docs/wakeable-codex.md`](docs/wakeable-codex.md).

**Sessions started before this change keep their duplicates.** The election is
applied at launch, so already-running peers with `-2`/`-2-2` twins only clean up
when you close and relaunch them.

**Claude sessions only activate peers when you launch via `agentpeers`.**
The `agentpeers` alias sets `AGENT_PEERS_ENABLED=1`. Plain `claude` does not, so the MCP loads in idle/no-op mode — no peer registration, no tab title change, no broker connection. This is intentional: the MCP is registered globally in `~/.claude.json`, so every `claude` session spawns it, and we don't want the peer network showing up in unrelated sessions.

**Codex always has peers active** (as long as you included `env = { "AGENT_PEERS_ENABLED" = "1" }` in your `config.toml` entry). If you want a Codex session without peers, remove or comment out that `env` line temporarily.

**Idle sessions don't auto-reply — they see messages on their next turn.**
Both Claude and Codex process peer messages **during turns**, not while idle at the prompt. If you send a message to a peer who is sitting at an empty prompt, they won't magically reply — their session will surface the message on its next user turn (when you type something, or ask them to "check messages"). This is a hard constraint of both Claude Code and Codex CLI, not a bug in this server — neither client exposes a way for an MCP server to trigger a turn from outside.

What we do to make this as painless as possible: **both agents are instructed to call `check_messages` at the start of every user turn.** Claude additionally has the live `<channel source="agent-peers" ...>` push path for mid-turn arrivals. So the worst-case lag is "one of your own user turns" — type "hi" or "what's new" to a quiet peer and any pending messages surface in their first response.

**`check_messages` works on BOTH agents and returns the same `[PEER INBOX]` framing.**
On Codex, it drains the durable on-disk queue. On Claude, it drains an in-memory ring buffer (last 15 min, max 50 messages) populated by the background channel-push loop. On either side, it's the reliable "give me my inbox" button. Just type "check messages" whenever you want to see what peers have sent.

**On Codex, the `notifications/message` preview is dormant.**
[OpenAI Codex CLI v0.120 docs](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/config.md) list `tools` as the only supported MCP feature — resources, prompts, and `notifications/message` are not surfaced to the model. We still emit the preview every poll tick as future-compatible plumbing. When a future Codex CLI adds MCP log-notification surfacing, it'll light up automatically with no code change. Today it's a no-op you can safely ignore.

**Tab title ("peer:calm-fox") is re-asserted every 1 second via OSC 0/1/2.**
Most terminals (iTerm2, Terminal.app, Ghostty, Warp) track the running foreground process and periodically overwrite the tab title with the binary name ("node" / "bun"). A one-shot OSC write at startup therefore decays. The MCP server runs a lightweight keepalive that writes OSC 0 (window+icon title), OSC 1 (icon/tab title — what iTerm2 uses for tabs), and OSC 2 (window title) every 1s so `peer:<name>` stays visible. If your terminal is configured with a hardcoded title source (e.g. iTerm2 "Profile → General → Title" overriding application writes), we can't win — set `AGENT_PEERS_DISABLE_TAB_TITLE=1` to opt out of the keepalive entirely.

**Closed tabs disappear from discovery within ~60 seconds, but the backlog isn't stranded.**
When you close a tab, the shell kills the session without graceful cleanup. The peer row stays in the broker until its heartbeat goes stale (~60s). `list_peers` filters stale peers out of results immediately — you won't see ghost peers there even in that window. If you restart with the same `PEER_NAME` within 60-90s, the broker reclaims the same UUID AND clears any stale leases for that peer, so the new session picks up undelivered backlog on its first poll instead of waiting up to 30s for leases to expire. Codex additionally persists its durable inbox on disk, so messages sitting on a reclaimed session are replayed even if they were drawn but not yet confirmed delivered.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No other peers found"**
Make sure at least two sessions are running with the MCP loaded. Run `bun cli.ts status` from a third shell to confirm the broker sees them.

**Broker port 7900 already in use**
Kill any old broker: `bun cli.ts kill-broker`. If another process owns the port, set `AGENT_PEERS_PORT=7901` in your env.

**Codex doesn't see the inbox**
Ask it to call `list_peers` or `check_messages` — messages surface on any agent-peers tool response, not just specific ones. If you still don't see the `[PEER INBOX]` block, your Codex version may not render tool responses verbatim; file an issue with your Codex version.

**Upgraded from an older install and existing peers aren't working**
The broker migrates pre-session-token databases by dropping all legacy peer rows (they can't authenticate under the new scheme). Restart all your sessions to re-register. Any in-flight messages for the dropped peers are visible via `bun cli.ts orphaned-messages`.

**`codexpeer` fails with "Cannot rollback while a turn is in progress"**
Fixed on 2026-08-06 — upgrade. Materialization used to run a throwaway model turn and
then delete it with `thread/rollback`; because `turn/start` returns *before* the
thread reports itself busy, the delete could land inside the still-running turn
(reproduced in 1 of 6 launches). Materialization no longer runs a turn at all, so
there is nothing to roll back. `thread/rollback` is also deprecated in codex-cli
0.146.1.

**One repo shows several peers with compounding names (`name-2`, `name-3-2-2-2`)**
Fixed on 2026-08-06 — relaunch the affected sessions. The app-server spawns one
agent-peers MCP per Codex thread and each used to register separately; children now
elect a single root. Already-running sessions keep their duplicates until relaunched.
If you see this on a *fresh* launch, that is a real bug — check that the launcher
passed `AGENT_PEERS_WAKE_LAUNCH=1` (`ps eww` on the app-server).

**Running alongside upstream `claude-peers-mcp`**
They coexist cleanly on different ports (7900 vs 7899) and different MCP names (`agent-peers` vs `claude-peers`). You can use both simultaneously; they don't share state.

## Coexistence with upstream `claude-peers-mcp`

|  | upstream `claude-peers-mcp` | this `agent-peers-mcp` |
|---|---|---|
| Broker port | 7899 | 7900 |
| SQLite | `~/.claude-peers.db` | `~/.agent-peers.db` |
| MCP name | `claude-peers` | `agent-peers` |
| Alias | `claudedpeers` | `agentpeers` |
| Codex support | No | Yes |
| Session-token auth | No | Yes |
| Orphan observability | No | Yes |
| Self-rename tool | No | Yes |

Both can run simultaneously. They do not talk to each other — you'd run `claudedpeers` for the upstream network and `agentpeers` for this one.

---

## Delivery contract

**Within a single session** — deterministic dedupe by `message_id` via in-memory seen-set. Same message is never delivered twice while your process is alive.

**Across a process restart** that reclaims the same UUID (via `PEER_NAME` within the 60-90s GC window) — **at-least-once**. A message polled but not acked before a crash may be re-delivered once. Replies should be idempotent.

**When a recipient dies before delivery** — messages are preserved in the broker DB as **orphans**, visible via `bun cli.ts orphaned-messages`. Never silently lost.

**Peer-to-peer security** — every peer gets a session token on register. Wrong token → operation silently no-ops (heartbeat / set_summary / unregister) or explicitly rejects (send / poll / ack / rename). You cannot impersonate, drain, or rename another peer via the MCP.

---

## Update (pull latest version)

**Same ownership split as Install.** Whoever owns the shared repo is responsible for pulling new code. Do NOT run the update prompt from both agents concurrently — they'll race on `git pull`, `bun install`, and broker kill.

**Pick your case:**

| Your setup | What to run | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 **Claude only** | Claude update prompt | Pulls repo, reinstalls deps, runs tests, tells you to restart any running `agentpeers` sessions |
| 🧠 **+** 🤖 **Both** | Claude update prompt **only** (Claude owns the shared repo) | Pulls repo, reinstalls deps, runs tests, tells you to restart BOTH `agentpeers` AND `codex` sessions |
| 🤖 **Codex only** | Codex-only update prompt | Pulls repo, reinstalls deps, runs tests, tells you to restart Codex sessions |

> **If you run the Codex-only update prompt with Claude ALSO wired up**, it will detect the conflict (checks `~/.claude.json` for an `agent-peers` entry) and stop with a message telling you to run the Claude update prompt instead. This is a safety rail — do not override it.

> **Why is there no "Codex update after Claude update" step?** Codex doesn't own the repo in the mixed-agents case. Once Claude has pulled new code, Codex just needs to be relaunched so the new `codex-server.ts` loads into the new MCP process. That's "close the terminal and open a new one," not a prompt.

<summary><b>🧠 For Claude Code — update prompt</b> (the ONLY update prompt if you have both agents installed) — <i>click to expand</i></summary>

Open a Claude Code session and paste this verbatim:

````
Update agent-peers-mcp to the latest version on my machine.

Step 1 — find the install directory. Likely locations: ~/Github Repos/agent-peers-mcp, ~/agent-peers-mcp, or elsewhere under my home directory. If you find more than one candidate, or you're uncertain, LIST the candidates and ASK me which one to update before proceeding. Do NOT modify anything until I confirm.

Once I confirm the path, do all of the following in order:

1. cd into the confirmed install directory.

2. Stop any running broker daemon so the upgrade can replace files cleanly:
   - Run `lsof -t -i:7900` to find broker PIDs.
   - Kill each with `kill -TERM <pid>` (SIGKILL after 2s if needed).
   - Also try `bun cli.ts kill-broker` as a fallback.

3. Record the current commit SHA for rollback reference:
   `git rev-parse --short HEAD` — save the value so you can tell me later.

4. DIRTY WORKTREE CHECK — before any destructive git action:
   Run `git status --porcelain`. If it produces ANY output (modified, added, or untracked files), STOP. Show me the output and ask whether I want to: (a) stash my changes and proceed, (b) abort the update, or (c) blow the changes away with a hard reset. Do NOT proceed to step 5 until I answer.
   If `git status --porcelain` is empty, continue.

5. Pull the latest code. Prefer a fast-forward pull so accidental rebases or divergent local commits surface as an error rather than a silent clobber:
   `git fetch origin main && git pull --ff-only origin main`
   If that fails (e.g. because we chose "blow away changes" in step 4, or local commits diverged), fall back to `git reset --hard origin/main` — but only after explicit confirmation.

6. Refresh dependencies:
   `bun install`

7. Run the test suite as a sanity check:
   `bun test`
   If any test fails, STOP and show me the failure output — do NOT tell me the update is complete.

8. Print a summary: old commit SHA, new commit SHA, the short-log between them (`git log --oneline <old>..HEAD`), and what tests passed.

9. Tell me to close and relaunch any running `agentpeers` AND `codex` sessions so the new MCP server code is loaded. Both agents share this repo, so both sets of sessions need to restart. Existing sessions keep running the OLD code until they restart.

Confirm each step's outcome as you go. If any step fails, stop and ask me how to proceed — don't silently move on.

Open a Codex session and paste this verbatim. **Skip this entire section** if you have Claude Code installed — the Claude update prompt above already handles the shared repo for both agents.

````
Update agent-peers-mcp to the latest version on my machine.

CRITICAL — before starting, verify I am the sole installer of this MCP:

1. Check ~/.claude.json — if it has an entry with name "agent-peers" OR an mcpServers["agent-peers"] key, Claude Code is ALSO wired to this shared repo. STOP immediately and tell me: "Claude Code is also using this install. The shared repo update is Claude's job — paste the Claude Code update prompt from the README into a Claude session instead. Once Claude has updated, come back here and I'll just tell you to restart your Codex sessions." Do NOT proceed.

2. If ~/.claude.json has NO agent-peers entry (or the file doesn't exist), I am the sole installer. Continue.

Step 2 — find the install directory. Likely locations: ~/Github Repos/agent-peers-mcp, ~/agent-peers-mcp, or elsewhere under my home directory.

## Uninstall

**Same ownership split, but reversed order vs install.** Why? When you're tearing down, you want Codex to STOP trying to launch the MCP binary *before* Claude deletes that binary. Otherwise every new `codex` session you open after uninstall will error on startup looking for a file that's gone.

**Pick your case:**

| Your setup | What to run | Order + why |
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 **Claude only** | Claude uninstall prompt | 1 step — it removes Claude's MCP registration, the `agentpeers` alias, the shared repo, the broker, and all `~/.agent-peers*` state files. |
| 🧠 **+** 🤖 **Both** | Codex uninstall prompt **first**, then Claude uninstall prompt | **Codex FIRST** so Codex stops trying to spawn `codex-server.ts` on every new session. Codex's uninstall auto-detects the two-agent case and does a **config-only** teardown (removes only the `~/.codex/config.toml` block, leaves the shared repo alone). Then Claude's uninstall tears down the shared repo, broker, DB, alias, secret file, and Codex's durable inbox directory. |
| 🤖 **Codex only** | Codex uninstall prompt | 1 step — Codex's uninstall auto-detects the solo case (no `agent-peers` entry in `~/.claude.json`) and does a **full** teardown: removes its `config.toml` block AND the shared repo, broker, DB, secret, and inbox directory. |

> **Why the Codex prompt auto-branches instead of being two different prompts:** one prompt handles all three cases reliably by reading `~/.claude.json` up-front to figure out whether shared state is Claude's to clean up or Codex's. If it finds Claude wired, it does "Case A" (config-only). If it doesn't, "Case B" (full teardown). This keeps the README short and prevents the user picking the wrong prompt.

> **Why Claude uninstall checks Codex's config.toml:** it looks for a lingering `[mcp_servers.agent-peers]` entry and warns you before deleting the shared repo. It does NOT auto-edit `~/.codex/config.toml` — that's Codex's prompt's job. The warning is there so you don't end up with a dangling Codex wiring pointing at a deleted binary.

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 For Codex — uninstall prompt</b> (run this FIRST if you have both agents installed) — <i>click to expand</i></summary>

Open a Codex session and paste this verbatim:

````
Remove the agent-peers MCP wiring from my Codex config. I may or may not still want Claude Code to keep using the shared repo — detect which and act accordingly.

Do NOT wipe anything until you've done this detection step:

1. Check ~/.claude.json for an "agent-peers" MCP entry (either a top-level `agent-peers` block or an mcpServers["agent-peers"] key). Tell me explicitly which case we're in:
   - CASE A — Claude Code is also wired up: I'm doing a config-only teardown on the Codex side. The shared repo, node_modules, broker, and DB are staying — they belong to Claude Code. My only job is to remove my Codex wiring.
   - CASE B — Claude Code is NOT wired up (or ~/.claude.json doesn't exist / has no agent-peers entry): I'm the sole installer, so I will do a FULL teardown — config, shared repo, and broker state.

Ask me to confirm which case applies before touching anything. If I confirm CASE A, proceed with steps 2-3 below. If CASE B, proceed with steps 2-6.

STEP 2 (both cases) — Remove the [mcp_servers.agent-peers] block from ~/.codex/config.toml. Keep every other mcp_servers entry and every other section intact. If you are not 100% certain you can surgically edit TOML, FIRST show me the exact block you intend to remove and ask me to confirm before writing.

STEP 3 (CASE A only) — Summarize: tell me "Codex wiring removed. Shared repo at <path> and DB at ~/.agent-peers* are Claude Code's to own — if you want those gone too, run the Claude Code uninstall prompt from the README next." Stop here.

STEP 4 (CASE B only) — Stop the broker:
   - Run `lsof -t -i:7900` to find broker PIDs.
   - Kill each one with `kill -TERM <pid>` (SIGKILL after 2s if needed).
   - Also run `bun cli.ts kill-broker` from inside the repo directory if it still exists.

STEP 5 (CASE B only) — Find and delete the shared repo. Likely locations: ~/Github Repos/agent-peers-mcp, ~/agent-peers-mcp. If you find more than one or are uncertain, LIST candidates and ASK me before deleting. Remove recursively.

STEP 6 (CASE B only) — Delete all broker state files in my home directory:
   rm -f ~/.agent-peers.db ~/.agent-peers.db-shm ~/.agent-peers.db-wal ~/.agent-peers-secret
   rm -rf ~/.agent-peers-codex
   Run `ls -la ~/.agent-peers* 2>/dev/null || echo 'clean'` to confirm nothing is left.

STEP 7 (CASE B only) — Summarize: list every path/resource you removed and paste the `ls -la ~/.agent-peers* 2>/dev/null || echo 'clean'` output so I can verify.

Confirm each step's outcome as you go. If any step fails, stop and ask me how to proceed — don't silently move on.

<summary><b>🧠 For Claude Code — uninstall prompt</b> (tears down the shared repo + broker + DB) — <i>click to expand</i></summary>

Open a Claude Code session and paste this verbatim. **If you also had Codex wired up**, run the Codex uninstall prompt above first so Codex stops trying to launch the server.

````
Completely uninstall agent-peers-mcp for me — I want every trace gone from the Claude side + the shared state.

Step 1 — find the install directory. Likely locations: ~/Github Repos/agent-peers-mcp, ~/agent-peers-mcp, or elsewhere under my home directory. If you find more than one candidate, or you're uncertain, LIST the candidates and ASK me which one to remove before proceeding. Do NOT delete anything until I confirm.

Step 2 — Codex coexistence check. Read ~/.codex/config.toml. If it still contains a [mcp_servers.agent-peers] block, WARN me: "Codex is still wired to this MCP — after I remove the shared repo, Codex will fail to start any new session until you also remove its [mcp_servers.agent-peers] block (run the Codex uninstall prompt). Want me to continue anyway?" Do not auto-edit Codex's config — that's its own prompt's job.

Once I confirm the path (and any warnings), do a FULL wipe — do not ask per-item confirmations; just do everything:

1. Stop any running broker daemon:
   - Run `lsof -t -i:7900` to find the broker PID(s).
   - Kill each one with `kill -TERM <pid>` (or SIGKILL if SIGTERM doesn't work within 2s).
   - Also run `bun cli.ts kill-broker` from inside the confirmed repo directory if the repo still exists at this point — it's another way to stop the broker.

2. Unregister the MCP from Claude Code:
   claude mcp remove agent-peers

3. Remove the launcher alias from ~/.zshrc. The line looks like:
   alias agentpeers='AGENT_PEERS_ENABLED=1 claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --dangerously-load-development-channels server:agent-peers'
   Delete that line (and any surrounding "# agent-peers-mcp" comment). Leave every other line in ~/.zshrc untouched.

4. Delete the cloned repo directory (the exact path I confirmed in Step 1) — remove recursively.

5. Delete ALL broker + Codex-inbox state files under my home directory:
   - ~/.agent-peers.db
   - ~/.agent-peers.db-shm
   - ~/.agent-peers.db-wal
   - ~/.agent-peers-secret
   - ~/.agent-peers-codex/ (directory, recursive — holds Codex's durable inbox files)
   Use `rm -f ~/.agent-peers.db ~/.agent-peers.db-shm ~/.agent-peers.db-wal ~/.agent-peers-secret` and `rm -rf ~/.agent-peers-codex` so missing paths don't error. Also run `ls -la ~/.agent-peers* 2>/dev/null` afterwards to confirm nothing is left.

6. Tell me to run `source ~/.zshrc` (or open a new terminal) so the alias change takes effect.

7. Give me a final summary listing every path and resource you removed, plus anything you couldn't remove and why. Also paste the output of `ls -la ~/.agent-peers* 2>/dev/null || echo 'clean'` so I can see it's fully gone. If I had Codex wired up and I haven't run the Codex uninstall prompt yet, remind me to do that now.

Confirm each step's outcome as you go. If any step fails, stop and ask me how to proceed — don't silently move on.
